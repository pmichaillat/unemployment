The section quizzes are designed to help review and assimilate the content from lecture. This content provides the building blocks that you will use in your research project. As such, mastering the lecture content is key, and the section quizzes are here to help you do that.

---

#### Presentation of readings

Most Tuesday class meetings will be devoted to discussing readings. 

To lead the discussion, students will give 10-minute presentations that summarize the readings for the week. Each student will give several presentations during the quarter (the exact number of presentations will depend on the enrollment). The presentations will be scheduled in advance.

Each presentation should have [6 slides addressing the following questions](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/presentations/readings/template.pdf):

1. CONTEXT: How does the paper relate to the lecture material? How does it contribute to the course material?
2. QUESTION: What is the research question addressed by the paper?
3. ANSWER: What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. ILLUSTRATION: Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
5. POSITIONING: How does the material in the paper contribute to the previous  literature?
6. CONCLUSION: What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved? What else would you have liked to know or learn on the topic?

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Slides should be submitted [to Ananyo by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu) before noon on the day of the presentation.

#### Research paper

Most Thursday class meetings will be devoted to research. Indeed, this is a research-intensive course, which will serve as good preparation for students interested in pursuing further studies in macroeconomics, especially a PhD. 

In this course you will shift away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. You will therefore devote a good part of the course to active research. You will learn:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper on a topic related to unemployment.

#### Objective of the paper

One of the main objectives of the course is to complete a short research paper. A good research paper should do the following:

1. Develop a well-posed, original research question
2. Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
3. Position the paper in the prior literature

Your research paper will be evaluated based on how well it accomplishes these three tasks. 

More specifically, a good research paper should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. It should describe in details the research question you are answering, and explain why it is an original and interesting question.
2. It should provide a thorough review of the prior literature, and it should explain how the paper advances that literature.
3. It should describe the model, data, empirical strategy, and computational method used to answer the questions. 
4. It should describe the results obtained in the analysis using diagrams, tables, and figures.
5. It should discuss the limitations of the current analysis, and how the limitations could be addressed in the future.

You should work on your research project on your own. However, you should feel free to discuss methods and literature, and to elicit feedback, from your peers.

#### Possible research questions

Any research question related to unemployment is acceptable for the research paper. The research question could involve unemployment directly or related labor-market phenomena (nonparticipation, part-time employment, underemployment, job vacancies, unemployment insurance, etc.). The question can look at the US labor market, at national labor markets abroad, or at local labor markets (in a specific US states, specific commuting zones, or specific industries).

You are welcome to work on any research question that you would like. If you are looking for some inspiration, I would encourage you to look at the readings for the course. There are several ways to write research papers based on any of the papers assigned as reading:

+ Reproduce the empirical or numerical results of the paper
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper by looking at different outcomes or implications of framework
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper, using more recent data or data for different countries
+ Modify the empirical or numerical results of the paper, using different assumptions or different computational or statistical methods

#### Concrete example of research question

In one of the course readings, [Shimer (2005)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828572) estimates the fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies in the US, and simulates the fluctuations in a DMP model. In your research paper, you could:

+ Reproduce the estimation
+ Reproduce the simulations
+ Redo the estimation or simulation using newer US data (Shimer stops in 2003) or older US data (Shimer starts in 1951, but [data are now available from 1930](https://github.com/pmichaillat/feru))
+ Redo the estimation in a different country
+ Redo the simulation by calibrating the DMP model for a different country
+ Redo the simulation by using a different matching model, such as a model with [wage rigidity](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828482) or [job rationing](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.4.1721)

#### Due dates

+ Thursday 6 February: presentations of project outlines in class
+ Tuesday 25 February & Thursday 27 February: presentations of early results in class
+ Tuesday 11 March & Thursday 13 March: presentations of final results in class
+ Thursday 20 March at noon: final paper due [by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu)

#### Presentation format: project outline

The project outline should be [presented in 10 minutes with 5 slides](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/presentations/projectoutlines/template.pdf).

+ Slide 1 – Research question: what are you asking in the project & why that matters

It is fine to propose several possible research questions if you are unsure. Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Slides should be submitted [to Ananyo by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu) before noon on the day of the presentation.

#### Presentation format: early results

Early results should be [presented in 10 minutes with 6 slides](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/presentations/earlyresults/template.pdf).

+ Slide 1 – Rapid review the research question & project positioning
+ Slides 2 + 3 – Detailed presentation of the research methodology, including data & model
+ Slides 4 + 5 – Detailed presentation of the early results, with tables & graphs
+ Slide 6 – Existing research hurdles & next steps

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Slides should be submitted [to Ananyo by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu) before noon on the day of the presentation.

#### Presentation format: final results

Final results should be [presented in 10 minutes with 6 slides](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/presentations/finalresults/template.pdf).

+ Slide 1 – Review the research question & project positioning
+ Slide 2 – Review of the methodology, including data & model

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Slides should be submitted [to Ananyo by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu) before noon on the day of the presentation.

#### Format of the paper

Your research paper should be short and follow the guidelines:

+ Manuscripts must be less than 6,000 words. The wordcount applies to the main body of the text and title page but excludes the reference list.
+ Manuscripts should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Manuscripts must include an abstract of 150 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should typically be contained in the paper. This is the case when the proof itself provides insight into the paper's argument or when the method of proof is innovative.

The research paper must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources), compiled to a PDF, and [submitted to Ananyo by email](mailto:abrahma@ucsc.edu) before noon on the due date.

#### Structure of the paper

The structure of your paper should support your argument. It should help convince the reader that you have answered your research question in a compelling way. There is not a mandatory structure: you should look at the [papers assigned as reading](#schedule-of-readings) to find good templates for your structure. 

For an empirical paper, a typical structure is the following:

+ Introduction – Less than 2 pages – Present your research question, position your paper in the literature, and provide an overview of your answer.
+ Data – 1–2 pages – Present your data, including where they come from and what they cover and what the summary statistics are.
+ Main answer to the research question – 3–6 pages – Present the central analysis of the paper. This section is the core of the paper. In it you should explain and justify the methodology. Then you should present the empirical results—both in graphical form and then in regression table form. Finally you should interpret the results; that is, you should explain what the numerical results mean in words and what their implications might be, for instance for policy.
+ Robustness – 1–3 pages – Present the robustness checks that you conducted, to convince the readers that your main results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and assumptions. The goal is to show that your results do not depend on the details of the analysis, but that they are valid across a range of comparable approaches.
+ Extensions – 1–3 pages – Present further empirical investigations related to your main question. The extensions could investigate mechanisms behind your results, or look at related empirical questions, or look at some special cases. The goal of these extensions is to understand better the main result.
+ Conclusion – Less than 2 pages – Briefly summarize your results, then discuss the implications of the results, especially for policy. Discuss the limitations of the analysis and explain how these limitations could be addressed in future research.

#### Code and data

Any code and data used in the analysis must be submitted with the paper. This applies both to code used to simulate models and to code used to analyse data. 

The code should be commented so that a reader can understand how to code works. The code should also work out of the box, so that the entire analysis can be reproduced with one prompt. Please include a README file describing all files and explaining how to run the code and obtain the results. Please use the following code & data repository as a template: https://github.com/pmichaillat/feru.

The easiest way to submit the code is to create a public GitHub repository, upload code and data there, and share the link with Ananyo. Another way is to place all code and data to a folder, zip it, and email it to Ananyo.

#### Math resources

The course relies on basic mathematical methods such as unconstrained and constrained optimization, and linear and nonlinear differential equations—including phase diagrams.

So you are expected to have good command of this material. Appropriate courses in the department of Applied Mathematics will provide a great preparation for the course. In additional, a good reference for the material used in the course is [Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Mathematics-Economic-Analysis-Sydsaeter-dp-1292359285/dp/1292359285/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by K. Sydsaeter, P. Hammond, A. Strom, and A. Carvajal.

See also [these lecture notes](https://pascalmichaillat.org/x/) for a review of the material—although not everything covered in these notes is required for the course.

---

#### Writing resources

There is no textbook for this course, but several books might be helpful to write your research paper.

First and foremost, a good research paper needs to have a good structure. A good reference on how to structure your paper is [The Little Book of Research Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Research-Writing/dp/1974673162) by V. Chaubey.

Scientific papers involve an elements that does not appear in other writings but is fundamental to communicate scientific ideas: graphs. It is important to make clear, clean, and meaningful graphs. A great reference on how to create compelling graphs is [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by E.R. Tufte.

Once your paper has a good structure and good graphs, it does not hurt to have a decent style—to help readers go through the paper. The canonical reference on style is [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426) by W. Strunk and E. B. White.

Whatever you write, it is important to follow the rules and conventions of the English language. The canonical manual—followed by most US journals—is the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). You should consult it if you have any question about English writing, rules, conventions, and style.

#### LaTeX resources

LaTeX is the best system to typeset scientific research. In particular, it allows to typeset mathematical expressions, insert tables and figures with results, and manage scientific references. This is why you are asked to write your presentation slides and research paper in LaTeX. If you continue on a research path, you will need to use LaTeX, so it is good to learn how to use it now.

LaTeX templates are available on GitHub to help you write your presentations and research paper:

+ [LaTeX template for research paper](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper)
+ [LaTeX template for research presentations](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-presentation)

These templates follow typographical best practices and have a minimalist design. You can also [use these LaTeX commands](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) in conjunction with the templates to obtain mathematical expressions that are more legible and easier to manipulate.

If you are new to LaTeX, feel free [to use Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz), for which UCSC supplies professional accounts. Overleaf makes it easy to produce research paper and research presentations in LaTeX directly from your web browser. You can use the above templates with Overleaf.
