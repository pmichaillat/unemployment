The main readings cover important material on which the lectures are based. You should read them from beginning to end. Additional readings are also be provided: these readings give additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, some background, and may be an inspiration for your research.

---

#### Presentation of readings

Tuesday class meetings will be devoted to discussing readings. 

To lead the discussion, students will give 10-minute presentations that summarize the readings for the week. Each student will give several presentations during the quarter (the exact number of presentations will depend on the enrollment). The presentations will be [scheduled in advance](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/schedule.md).

Each presentation should have 6 slides addressing the following questions:

1. Context - How does the paper relate to the lecture material? How does it contribute to the course material?
2. Question - What is the research question addressed by the paper?
3. Answer - What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. Illustration - Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
5. Positioning - How does the paper contribute to the previous  literature?
6. Conclusion - What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved? What else would you have liked to know or learn on the topic?

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Presentation slides should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) before 8am on the day of the presentation.

#### Research paper

Thursday class meetings will be devoted to research. 

Indeed, this is a research-intensive course, which will serve as good preparation for students interested in pursuing further studies in economics, especially a PhD. In this course you will shift away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. You will therefore devote a good part of the course to active research. You will learn:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper on a topic related to unemployment.

#### Objective of the paper

One of the main objectives of the course is to complete a short research paper. A good research paper should do the following:

1. Develop a well-posed, original research question
2. Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
3. Position the paper in the prior literature

Your research paper will be evaluated based on how well it accomplishes these three tasks. More specifically, a good research paper should adhere to the following guidelines:

1. It should describe in details the research question you are answering, and explain why it is an original and interesting question.
2. It should provide a thorough review of the prior literature, and it should explain how the paper advances that literature.
3. It should describe the model, data, empirical strategy, and computational method used to answer the questions. 
4. It should describe the results obtained in the analysis using diagrams, tables, and figures.
5. It should discuss the limitations of the current analysis, and how the limitations could be addressed in the future.

You should work on your research project on your own. However, you should feel free to discuss methods and literature, and to elicit feedback, from your peers. To get you started, [this document presents possible ideas](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/ideas.md) for the research project.

#### Due dates

+ Thursday 16 October: presentation of project outline in class
+ Thursday 13 November: presentation of early results in class
+ Tuesday 2 December & Thursday 4 December: presentation of final results  in class
+ Thursday 11 December: submission of final paper before noon

#### Presentation of project outline

The project outline should be presented in 10 minutes with 5 slides.

+ Slide 1 – Research question: what are you asking in the project & why that matters
+ Slide 2 – Positioning: what we already know & what we do not yet know
+ Slide 3 – Research methodology: how you will address the research question
+ Slide 4 – Overview of what you have so far: data & model & code & other ideas
+ Slide 5 – Existing & projected hurdles & next steps

It is fine to propose several possible research questions if you are unsure. 

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Presentation slides should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) before 8am on the day of the presentation.

#### Presentation of early results

Early results should be presented in 10 minutes with 6 slides.

+ Slide 1 – Review the research question & project positioning
+ Slides 2 + 3 – Detailed presentation of the research methodology, including data & model
+ Slides 4 + 5 – Detailed presentation of the early results, with tables & graphs
+ Slide 6 – Existing research hurdles & next steps

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Presentation slides should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) before 8am on the day of the presentation.

#### Presentation of final results

Final results should be presented in 10 minutes with 6 slides.

+ Slide 1 – Review the research question & project positioning
+ Slide 2 – Review of the methodology, including data & model
+ Slides 3 + 4 + 5 – Detailed presentation of final theoretical & empirical & computational results, with tables & graphs
+ Slide 6 – Implications of the results, for instance for policy, & limitations

Presentation slides must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. Presentation slides should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) before 8am on the day of the presentation.

#### Structure of the research paper

The structure of your paper should support your argument. It should help convince the reader that you have answered your research question in a compelling way. 

Your research paper should be short and adhere to the following guidelines:

+ Paper must be less than 6,000 words. The wordcount applies to the main body of the text and title page but excludes the reference list.
+ Paper should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Paper must include an abstract of 150 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. 

There is not a mandatory structure. You should look at the papers assigned as readings to find good templates for your structure. For an empirical paper, a typical structure is the following:

+ Introduction – Less than 2 pages – Present your research question, position your paper in the literature, and provide an overview of your answer.
+ Data – Less than 2 pages – Present your data, including where they come from and what they cover and what the summary statistics are.
+ Main answer to the research question – 3–6 pages – Present the central analysis of the paper. This section is the core of the paper. In it you should explain and justify the methodology. Then you should present the empirical results—both in graphical form and then in regression table form. Finally you should interpret the results; that is, you should explain what the numerical results mean in words and what their implications might be, for instance for policy.
+ Robustness – 1–3 pages – Present the robustness checks that you conducted, to convince the readers that your main results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and assumptions. The goal is to show that your results do not depend on the details of the analysis, but that they are valid across a range of comparable approaches.
+ Extensions – 1–3 pages – Present further empirical investigations related to your main question. The extensions could investigate mechanisms behind your results, or look at related empirical questions, or look at some special cases. The goal of these extensions is to understand better the main result.
+ Conclusion – Less than 1 pages – Briefly summarize your results, then discuss the implications of the results, especially for policy. Discuss the limitations of the analysis and explain how these limitations could be addressed in future research.

The research paper must be [written in LaTeX](#latex-resources) and compiled to a PDF. The paper should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) before noon on the due date.

#### Code and data

Any code and data used in the analysis must be submitted with the paper. This applies both to code used to simulate models and to code used to analyse data. Code and data should be [uploaded into your GitHub repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/unemployment/blob/main/github.md) at the same time as your research paper.

The code should be commented so that a reader can understand how to code works. The code should also work out of the box, so that the entire analysis can be reproduced with one prompt. Please include a README file describing all files and explaining how to run the code and obtain the results. Please use the following code and data repository as a template: https://github.com/pmichaillat/feru.

#### Math resources

The course relies on basic mathematical methods such as unconstrained and constrained optimization, and linear and nonlinear differential equations—including phase diagrams.

So you are expected to have good command of this material. Appropriate courses in the department of Applied Mathematics will provide a great preparation for the course. In additional, a good reference for the material used in the course is [Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Mathematics-Economic-Analysis-Sydsaeter-dp-1292359285/dp/1292359285/ref=dp_ob_title_bk), by K. Sydsaeter, P. Hammond, A. Strom, and A. Carvajal.

See also [these lecture notes](https://pascalmichaillat.org/x/) for a review of the material—although not everything covered in these notes is required for the course.

#### Writing resources

There is no textbook for this course, but several books might be helpful to write your research paper.

First and foremost, a good research paper needs to have a good structure. A good reference on how to structure your paper is [The Little Book of Research Writing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Research-Writing/dp/1974673162) by V. Chaubey.

Scientific papers involve an elements that does not appear in other writings but is fundamental to communicate scientific ideas: graphs. It is important to make clear, clean, and meaningful graphs. A great reference on how to create compelling graphs is [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) by E.R. Tufte.

Once your paper has a good structure and good graphs,  a decent style helps readers navigate the paper. The canonical reference on English style is [The Elements of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-4th-William-Strunk/dp/0205313426) by W. Strunk and E. B. White.

Whatever you write, it is important to follow the rules and conventions of the English language. The canonical manual—followed by most US journals—is the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). You should consult it if you have any question about English writing, rules, conventions, and style.

#### LaTeX resources

LaTeX is the best system to typeset scientific research. In particular, it allows to typeset mathematical expressions, insert tables and figures with results, and manage scientific references. This is why you are asked to write your presentation slides and research paper in LaTeX. If you continue on a research path, you will need to use LaTeX, so it is good to learn how to use it now.

LaTeX templates are available on GitHub to help you write your presentations and research paper:

+ [LaTeX template for research paper](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper)
+ [LaTeX template for research presentations](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-presentation)

These templates follow typographical best practices and have a minimalist design. You can also [use these LaTeX commands](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) in conjunction with the templates to obtain mathematical expressions that are more legible and easier to manipulate.

If you are new to LaTeX, feel free [to use Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/edu/ucsantacruz), for which UCSC supplies professional accounts. Overleaf makes it easy to produce research paper and research presentations in LaTeX directly from your web browser. You can use the above templates with Overleaf.

#### Generative artificial intelligence (AI)

In this course, a primary objective is for you to develop the critical thinking, research, and writing skills essential for your academic and professional career. To ensure you are the sole author of your work, the use of generative AI tools—such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude—for generating any portion of your submitted assignments is strictly prohibited. This includes using AI to brainstorm, create outlines, write drafts, summarize articles, or rephrase text. You are, of course, welcome to use standard tools that check grammar and spelling on text you have already written yourself.

Our goal in this class is to work on our research and writing skills together. We ask that all submitted work is your own original creation from start to finish to make sure you get the most out of every assignment. Relying on AI to generate your text short-circuits this critical practice.
