### Possible ideas for the research papers

#### Overview of possible research questions

Any research question related to unemployment is acceptable for the research paper. The research question could involve unemployment directly or related labor-market phenomena (nonparticipation, part-time employment, underemployment, job vacancies, unemployment insurance, and so on). The question can look at the US labor market, at foreign labor markets, or at local labor markets in the US or abroad (in a specific US states, specific commuting zones, or specific industries).

You are welcome to work on any research question that you would like. If you are looking for some inspiration, I would encourage you to look at the readings for the course. There are several ways to write research papers based on any of the papers assigned as reading:

+ Reproduce the empirical or numerical results of the paper
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper by looking at different outcomes or implications of framework
+ Extend the empirical or numerical results of the paper, using more recent data or data for different countries
+ Modify the empirical or numerical results of the paper, using different assumptions or different computational or statistical methods

#### A concrete example of research paper

In one of the course readings, [Shimer (2005)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828572) estimates the fluctuations in unemployment and vacancies in the US, and simulates the fluctuations in a DMP model. In your research paper, you could:

+ Reproduce the estimation
+ Reproduce the simulations
+ Redo the estimation or simulation using newer US data (Shimer stops in 2003) or older US data (Shimer starts in 1951, but [data are now available from 1930](https://github.com/pmichaillat/feru))
+ Redo the estimation in a different country
+ Redo the simulation by calibrating the DMP model to a different country
+ Redo the simulation by using a different model, such as a model with [wage rigidity](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828482) or [job rationing](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.4.1721)

#### Another concrete example of research paper

In another of the course readings, [Michaillat and Saez (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1111/obes.12685) develop a simple rule to detect US recessions from data on unemployment and job vacancies. In your research paper, you could:

+ Reconstruct the rule and re-assess its historical performance
+ Construct a similar rule in a different country. This would require finding new thresholds for the new country.
+ Construct new variants of the rule for the US economy or other economies, maybe using different labor market data.
+ Construct rules to detect the end of recessions instead of the start of recessions, in the United States or abroad.
